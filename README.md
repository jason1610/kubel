### A Daily 2D Rubik's Cube Challenge
### [Try It Out](https://jason1610.github.io/kubel/)
Kubel is a minimalist puzzle game where you slide pieces to solve a unique challenge each day. The goal is simple: move all pieces of the same color next to each other using as few moves as possible.

### How to Play

-   Click and drag to move entire rows or columns.

-   Pieces wrap around the edges of the grid.

-   Solve the puzzle in the fewest moves possible.

### Potential Roadmap

🚀 **Local Storage** --- Save play state.\
🎨 **Free Mode** --- Play endlessly with random scrambles, colors, and sizes.\
🛠 **Puzzle Builder** --- Create and share custom puzzles.\
🏆 **Leaderboards** --- Compete for the best solutions.

The core logic is in `page.svelte`. This is a remake of one of my old projects, now refined for a daily challenge format.
